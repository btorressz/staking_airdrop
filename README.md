# staking_airdrop

This project implements a **staking-based airdrop system** on the Solana blockchain using the **Anchor framework**. Users can stake tokens to earn additional token rewards and gain access to premium features. The staking system encourages long-term commitment and aligns user incentives with the success of the platform.

## Features

- **Token Staking**: Users can lock up tokens for a predefined period to receive higher allocations in airdrops.
- **Premium Access**: Users who stake a minimum amount of tokens receive premium access to platform features.
- **Unstaking & Rewards**: After the staking period ends, users can unstake their tokens and claim rewards based on the duration and amount staked.

## Technology Stack

- **Solana**: High-performance blockchain for decentralized apps and cryptocurrencies.
- **Anchor Framework**: A Rust-based framework for writing and deploying Solana programs.
- **SPL Tokens**: Solanaâ€™s token standard used for creating and managing fungible and non-fungible tokens.
- **Solana Playground**: A web-based environment to test and run Solana programs interactively.
